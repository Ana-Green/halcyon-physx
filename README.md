# Halcyon PhysX
Halcyon-tuned C# conversion of NVIDIA PhysX SDK.

This is a reporting PhysX from C++ to C# using newer tools.

## Building
At the moment this has only been developped for Linux, though Windows is on the radar. MacOS is right off the edge of the horizon, but I think I can see its mast.

1. Bootstrap the project:
    ```bash
    $ ./bootstrap.sh
    ```
2. Open the folder in VSCode and run it.
